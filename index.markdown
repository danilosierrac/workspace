# [Handbook for a bearable workspace](http://danilosierrac.github.io/workspace/)

I am an office manager interested in tech and software development, so I decided to start this little project while teaching myself to code. Let's define a good workspace.

## Definition of a workspace
A workspace is any place where a human being can do any clerical or creative work on a consistently regular basis. This can be an office in a building, a workshop, an artist studio or a vehicle. For consistency, we are going to focus in the first two kinds.

## The basics

Every workspace should have some basic things considered, and by this it means assuring there are at least basic tools for the worker to code from.

### Physical space

There is a minimal area that a workspace should have. In the case of tech-related activities, an area of 3 m2 around the working person (assuming they are sitting at a desk) is recommendable.

### Basic furnishing

You should at least have the following items in your own workspace:

* A surface to place your tools on, which allows you to have your elbows in 90ยบ angle.
* A chair to sit down (unless you prefer standing) in straight position, if its height can be adjusted even better.
* A place to stow some belongins and occasionally needed tools.

### Illumination

Enough natural light is essential. During winter/dark hours it is necessary to have a supplemental source that provides an amount of light similar to an overcast day. A screen alone is harmful for your eyes. In the best case, try working only during day time.

_to asses in detail the implications of illumination, you can also refer to [This useful paper](http://www.oshr.nc.gov/Support/Safety/handbook/Illumination%20Final.pdf) ._

### Living matter

Having plants, a fish or a pet makes life more bearable. Surround yourself with something alive. Humans are ok, too. They all can be great.

### Close distance to food and drinks

Nomnomnom.
