# [The perfect workspace space](http://danilosierrac.github.io/workspace/)

What if you could have the workspace you dream of? I am an office manager interested in tech and software development, so I decided to start this little project while teaching myself to code.

## The basics

Every workspace should have some basic things considered, and by this it means assuring there are at least basic tools for the worker to code from.

### Physical space

There is a minimal area that a workspace should have. In the case of tech, a good amount is 3 m2 around the person (assuming they are sitting at a desk).


## Basic furnishing

You should at least have the following contraptions in your own workspace:

* A table to place your tools on, which allows you to have your elbows in 90ยบ angle.
* A chair to sit down (unless you prefer standing), if its height can be adjusted even better.
* A place to stow some belongins and unneeded tools.

## Illumination

You should have enough illumination. [This paper can be a powerful tool](http://www.oshr.nc.gov/Support/Safety/handbook/Illumination%20Final.pdf) to asses in detail its implication, but it should have at least a natural feeling, preferably if it is purely sunlight.
