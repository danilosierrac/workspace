# [The perfect office][self]

So you're organising a hack day or hackathon? Here are some basic requirements
to make your event a success, and avoid the common pitfalls that could otherwise
ruin it. If you cannot provide any of the following, make it clear to guests
before registration. Attendees are generally forgiving when clear communication
is given. These are only guidelines, but exist to help you run a hack day in the
easiest possible way.

## Announcing the event

Once you know when and how your event will take place, you'll want to tell the
world about it. At a bare minimum, you should decide on a canonical place where
all public information about the event lives - this might be a dedicated web
site, an event on an existing event online service or some other place which is
publicly accessible. Also, express clearly the nature of the event and the outcome.
No attendee should ever leave the event feeling he/she just gave away work for free, but
understanding clearly in which way they were specifically part of something big.

Once you've decided where that location is, use tools like Twitter and Facebook
to make people aware of the event, and also consider which Google Groups and
mailing lists developers relevant to your event may be hanging out. Don't spam
them, though - nobody enjoys that.

### Registration _Optional_

If you require your attendees to register, make it clear what information is
required for signing up and what the deadline for the registration is. If
there's a maximum number of attendees the venue can handle, communicate how the
selection process works and when/how people will be notified if they've been
granted attendance or not.

If there's a waiting list for the event, make sure to explain how it works.

Most registration forms lets applicants enter name, contact details and food
preferences/allergies (if applicable). Depending on your event and your venue,
you might want to ask for additional information - this manifesto lists a few
other topics which might make sense to add to the registration form.

There are also a number of things you probably should _not_ ask for, like
gender, religious preferences etc.
