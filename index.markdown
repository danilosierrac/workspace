# [Handbook for a bearable workspace](http://danilosierrac.github.io/workspace/)

I am an office manager interested in tech and software development, so I decided to start this little project while teaching myself to code. Let's define a good workspace.

## Definition of a workspace
A workspace is any place where a human being can do any clerical or creative work on a consistently regular basis. This can be an office in a building, a workshop, an artist studio or a vehicle. For consistency, we are going to focus in the first two kinds.

## The basics

Every workspace should have some basic things considered, and by this it means assuring there are at least basic tools for the worker to code from.

### Physical space

There is a minimal area that a workspace should have. In the case of tech-related activities, an area of 3 m2 around the working person (assuming they are sitting at a desk) is recommendable.

### Safety

Access to fire exits is quintessential. If any kind of instictive need is met, work will never be interrupted.

>Follow this [link](http://99u.com/articles/35951/the-cavemans-guide-to-building-a-better-office) to learn a bit more of how our basic instincts impact our expectations about workspaces.


### Basic furnishing

You should at least have the following items in your own workspace:

* A surface to place your tools on, which allows you to have your elbows in 90ยบ angle.
* A chair to sit down (unless you prefer standing) in straight position, if its height can be adjusted even better.
* A place to stow some belongins and occasionally needed tools.

### Illumination

Enough natural light is essential. During winter/dark hours it is necessary to have a supplemental source that provides an amount of light similar to an overcast day. A screen alone is harmful for your eyes. In the best case, try working only during day time.

### Living matter

Having plants, a fish or a pet makes life more bearable. Surround yourself with something alive. Humans are ok, too. They all can be great.

### Close distance to food and drinks

Nomnomnom! For this it is better to have a separate space, as smells, cleanup, and preparation can be moduled without much interruption or risk of severe work interference. If you have a cafeteria, a couple of restaurants, deliveries or a small kitchen, you are pretty much set up. Avoid in all ways possible eating from your desk.

## Communications

###Phone

If you share this space with other workers, and your job is not essentially making phone calls constantly, it is better to keep a _lights only_, silent or vibration mode. In many cases, avoiding interrupting others is the best contribution you can make.

###Internet Connection

* Keep it always password protected
* It should be, reliable and fast
* Try to provide symmetrical access
* Have a small, relatively slow guest connection for visitors

###Fax

* Keep it in a separate space to avoid noise, and if possible, through a digital application. The idea behind this recommendation is to avoid interruption of your work and the other people around you.
